Native Errors
=============

Native errors represent what you would get back from the operating system as an
error number. This is usually called ``errno``. ``revenge`` attempts to handle
resolution of these errors into more helpful strings automagically with the
class :class:`~revenge.native_error.NativeError`.

Examples: :class:`~revenge.native_error.NativeError`
